> Did you know that slab break-off and subduction polarity reversal after collision can be very fast?
> Our paper published in Geology provide a synthesis of the available data for 17 ancient and contemporary subduction zones (alongside new numerical models) to propose that slab break-off and polarity reversal can occur on geologically short timescales (<6 million years). The new work highlights the importance of a global perspective to local tectonic events.
